# space-invaders
Final Project of [How to Code: Simple Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-simple-data).
This course taught me about the benefits of systematic programming. And how a game complex like Space Invaders could be broken down into smaller pieces. Another amazing aspect of this course is that it puts a lot of emphasis on Test Driven Development. It might feel a bit slower in the beginning, but trust me later section has got some amazing content.
